OTP verification in android using firebase(java)
This is a simple mobile verification app made using java and xml.
This is made on the android studio.
To run the code in your setup keystore need to be changed and the connection to the firebase.
Google play integrity API is used here to call for verification of the app.
It is connected to the firebase which allows for the verification.
It is my one of the first project using mobile authentication.
Enabling google play integrity API before calling for otp verification is essential.
#SHA1 and #SHA256 keys are important for proper connection between the firebase and the android app.
